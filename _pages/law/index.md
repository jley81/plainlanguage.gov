The [Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/content-detail.html) was signed on October 13, 2010. The law requires that federal agencies use clear government communication that the public can understand and use.

While the Act does not cover regulations, three separate Executive Orders emphasize the need for plain language: [E.O. 12866](https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12866.pdf), [E.O. 12988](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1996-02-07/pdf/96-2755.pdf), and [E.O. 13563](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2011-01-21/pdf/2011-1385.pdf).
